= Lab 4 - Monitoring Applications

Cloud Foundry provides several built-in mechanisms that allow us to monitor our applications' state changes and behavior.
Additionally, Cloud Foundry actively monitors the health of our application processes and will restart them should they crash.
In this lab, we'll explore a few of these mechanisms.

== Events

Cloud Foundry only allows application configuration to be modified via its API.
This gives application operators confidence that all changes to application configuration are known and auditable.
It also reduces the number of causes that must be considered when problems arise.

All application configuration changes are recorded as _events_.
These events can be viewed via the Cloud Foundry API, and viewing is facilitated via the CLI.

. Take a look at the events that have transpired so far for our deployment of `orders-service-${initials}`:

<1> Events are sorted newest to oldest, so we'll start from the bottom.
Here we see the `app.create` event, which created our application's record and stored all of its metadata (e.g. `memory: 512`).
<2> The `app.map-route` event records the incoming request to assign a route to our application.
<3> This `app.update` event records the resulting change to our applications metadata.
<4> This `app.update` event records the change of our application's state to `STARTED`.
<5> Remember scaling the application up? This `app.update` event records the metadata change `instances: 3`.
<6> And here's the `app.update` event recording our scaling of the application back down with `instances: 1`.

== Logs

One of the most important enablers of visibility into application behavior is logging.
Effective management of logs has historically been very difficult.
Cloud Foundry's https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator[log aggregation] components simplify log management by assuming responsibility for it.
Application developers need only log all messages to either `STDOUT` or `STDERR`, and the platform will capture these messages.

=== For Developers

Application developers can view application logs using the CF CLI.

. Let's view recent log messages for `orders-service-${initials}`:
+
----
$ cf logs orders-service-${initials} --recent
----
+
Here are two interesting subsets of one output from that command:

As you can see, Cloud Foundry's log aggregation components capture both application logs and CF component logs relevant to your application.
These events are properly interleaved based on time, giving you an accurate picture of events as they transpired across the system.

. To get a running ``tail'' of the application logs rather than a dump, simply type:
+
----
$ cf logs orders-service-${initials}
----
+
You can try various things like refreshing the browser and triggering stop/start events to see logs being generated. Stop `cf logs <app_name>` output by pressing Ctrl-C.

== Health

Cloud Foundry https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/concepts/maintaining-high-availability.html[actively monitors the health of our application processes] and will restart them should they crash. 

> In this lab, you may want to have two terminal windows open to watch `cf logs` while reviewing `cf events`.

. If you don't have a terminal window already running, start a log tail for `orders-service-${initials}`:
+
----
$ cf logs orders-service-${initials}
----

. Let's stop the 3rd application instance of your app. See how Cloud Foundry automatically creates another app instance to match my desired capacity
+
----
$ cf restart-app-instance orders-service-${initials} 2
----
+

. Look at the application log now, you'll see some interesting log messages fly by:

= (SKIP for today's workshop. Consider doing these steps later) For Operators 

Application operators will also enjoy commands like `cf logs`, but are often interested in long-term retention, indexing, and analysis of logs as well.
Cloud Foundry currently only provides short-term retention of logs.
To meet these needs, Cloud Foundry provides the ability to http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management.html[drain logs to third-party providers.]

In this section, we'll drain logs to a very simple provider called https://papertrailapp.com[Papertrail].

. Visit https://papertrailapp.com and create a free account.

. Login to your account and add your first system:
+
image::../../Common/images/papertrail_1.png[]

. Click on ``Alternatives'':
+
image::../../Common/images/papertrail_2.png[]

. Choose ``I use Heroku'' and provide a name:
+
image::../../Common/images/papertrail_3.png[]

. Note the URL + Port assigned to your application:
+
image::../../Common/images/papertrail_4.png[]

. We'll use a Cloud Foundry http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html[user-provided service instance] to create the log drain for our application using the URL + Port provided by Papertrail:
+
----
$ cf cups orders-service-${initials}-logs -l syslog://logs2.papertrailapp.com:43882
Creating user provided service orders-service-${initials}-logs in org Workshop / space user1 as swomack@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. We bind that service instance like those we created in link:../lab_02/lab_02.adoc[Lab 2] (`cf bs` is short for `cf bind-service`):
+
----
$ cf bs orders-service-${initials} orders-service-${initials}-logs
Binding service orders-service-${initials}-logs to app orders-service-${initials} in org Workshop / space user1 as swomack@pivotal.io...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. We'll use a `cf restart` rather than `cf restage` to make the binding take effect:
+
----
$ cf restart orders-service-${initials}
----

. Refresh the Papertrail browser tab to see log events immediately flowing to the log viewing page:
+
image::../../Common/images/papertrail_5.png[]

You can see how to connect to other third-party log management systems in the http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management-thirdparty-svc.html[Cloud Foundry documentation].

== Clean Up

Because of the limited quota we have for this course, let's clean up our application and services to make room for future labs.

. Delete the `orders-service-${initials}` application (`cf d` is short for `cf delete`):
+
----
$ cf d orders-service-${initials}

Really delete the app orders-service-${initials}?> y
Deleting app orders-service-${initials} in org Workshop / space user1 as swomack@pivotal.io...

. Delete the `orders-service-${initials}-logs` service (`cf ds` is short for `cf delete-service`):
